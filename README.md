# Introduction

This project is about an 8 bit programmable computer made in and for LittleBigPlanet 3. This creates many possiblities; it can perform actual computing and gives you the ability to code on a children's game on your PlayStation. _Yeah... crazy!_

# Get Started

On **LittleBigPlanet 3**, there's a level called **""** made by DamianBossPL. Inside the level, you can either:

- **Use the sandbox** - This allows you to try out the computer without needing to get the prize for it
- **Get the prize bubble** - Bring it into your moon so that you have more freedom

Along side the computer, you can recieve some extra items like:

- **Pre-written programs** - Try out some programs I made
- **Non-volatile memory** - Allows you to make your own programs
- **A Programmer** - Writes a program into the computer's memory

# Specs

- CPU:
  - N1:
    - 0-15Hz Clock Speed - Controllable
    - 256 Bytes of Random Access Memory
  - N1 Max:
    - 30Hz Clock Speed - Uncontrollable
    - 256 Bytes of Random Access Memory

## Why 30Hz?

The speed is capped at 30Hz because it is a limitation of LittleBigPlanet 3 logic system where it updates logic with the game's framerate which is 30 frames per second.
